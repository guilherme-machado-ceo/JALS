# JALS - Just Another Language System

**JALS** is an innovative system for linguistic amplification through computational layers, designed to transform handwritten manuscripts into symbolic abstractions and multimodal linguistic integrations.

## 🎯 Vision

To create a computational system that amplifies human linguistic expression through the capture, abstraction, and integration of handwritten gestures into rich symbolic and linguistic representations.

## 🏗️ Architecture

JALS is built on a 4-layer architecture:

1. **Layer 1: Manuscript Encoding** - Capture and preprocessing of handwritten gestures
2. **Layer 2: Symbolic Abstraction** - Transformation into abstract symbols
3. **Layer 3: Language Integration** - Multimodal linguistic integration
4. **Layer 4: Computational Deployment** - Deployment across platforms

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/guilherme-machado-ceo/JALS.git
cd JALS

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from jals.core import CoreIdeogram, AmplificationEngine
from jals.layers import Layer1, Layer2, Layer3, Layer4

# Initialize components
ideogram = CoreIdeogram()
engine = AmplificationEngine()
layer1 = Layer1()
layer2 = Layer2()
layer3 = Layer3()
layer4 = Layer4()

# Process manuscript
manuscript_data = layer1.capture("data/samples/manuscript_samples.json")
symbolic_data = layer2.abstract(manuscript_data)
language_data = layer3.integrate(symbolic_data)
result = layer4.deploy(language_data)
```
